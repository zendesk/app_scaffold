# App Scaffold

## Description
This repo contains a scaffold to help developers build [apps for Zendesk products](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/getting_started).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.11.5
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) >= 2.0.x

### Setup
1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Change (`cd`) into the `app_scaffold` directory
3. Run `yarn install`

You can use either `yarn` or `npm` as package manager and run the scripts with the corresponding commands.

To run your app locally in Zendesk, you need the latest [Zendesk Command Line Interface (ZCLI)](https://github.com/zendesk/zcli).

### Running locally

To serve the app to your Zendesk instance with `?zcli_apps=true`, run

```
yarn run watch
zcli apps:server dist
```

## But why?
The App Scaffold includes many features to help you maintain and scale your app. Some of the features provided by the App Scaffold are listed below. However, you don't need prior experience in any of these to be able to use the scaffold successfully.

- [ES6 (ES2015)](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)

ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. The App Scaffold includes the [Babel compiler](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile your code to ES5. This allows you to use ES6 features, such as classes, arrow functions and template strings even in browsers that haven't fully implemented these features.

- [Zendesk Garden](https://garden.zendesk.com/css-components/) UI components

Collection of user interface components for Zendesk products. Youâ€™ll find components built to respond to a range of user input devices, tuned to handle right-to-left layouts, and finessed with just the right touch of subtle animation.

- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.github.io/) module bundler

Webpack is a module bundler, we use it to bundle up Javascript modules for use as web applications, also to perform tasks like transforming and transpiling, etc.

- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org//) stylesheets

PostCSS transforms stylesheets with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.

- [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) JS linting

StandardJS is a Javascript style guide, it helps catching style issues or code errors, and automatically formats code for you.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) Javascript testing framework

Jest is bundled with JSDom and built on top of Jasmine. It's more than just a ReactJS testing framework. In the Zendesk Apps team, we use it for unit and integration testing of the Official Apps. It also includes a good test coverage toolset out of the box.

## Folder structure

The folder and file structure of the App Scaffold is as follows:

| Name                                    | Description                                                                                  |

#### dist
The dist directory is created when you run the app building scripts. You will need to package this folder when submitting your app to the Zendesk Apps Marketplace, It is also the folder you will have to serve when using [ZCLI](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/zcli/). It includes your app's manifest.json file, an assets folder with all your compiled JavaScript and CSS as well as HTML and images.

#### spec
The spec directory is where all your tests and test helpers live. Tests are not required to submit/upload your app to Zendesk and your test files are not included in your app's package, however it is good practice to write tests to document functionality and prevent bugs.

#### src
The src directory is where your raw source code lives. The App Scaffold includes different directories for JavaScript, stylesheets, templates, images and translations. Most of your additions will be in here (and spec, of course!).

#### webpack
This directory contains custom tooling to process translations at build time:

- translations-loader.js is used by Webpack to convert .json translation files to JavaScript objects, for the app itself.
- translations-plugin.js is used to extract compulsory translation strings from the en.json file that are used to display metadata about your app on the Zendesk Apps Marketplace.


#### .babelrc
[.babelrc](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babelrc.html) is the configuration file for babel compiler.

#### .browserslistrc
.browserslistrc is a configuration file to specify browsers supported by your application, some develop/build tools read info from this file if it exists in your project root. At present, our scaffolding doesn't reply on this file, [default browserslist query](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries) is used by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env/) and [PostCSS](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env#browsers)

#### jest.config.js
[jest.config.js](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html) is the configuration file for Jest

#### package.json
package.json is the configuration file for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which is a package manager for JavaScript. This file includes information about your project and its dependencies. For more information on how to configure this file, see [Yarn package.json](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json).

#### postcss.config.js
postcss.config.js is the configuration file for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

#### webpack.config.js
webpack.config.js is a configuration file for [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler. For more information about webpack and how to configure it, see [What is webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html).

## Helpers
The App Scaffold provides some helper functions in `/src/javascripts/lib/helpers.js` to help building apps.

### I18n
The I18n (internationalization) module in `/src/javascripts/lib/i18n.js` provides a `t` method to look up translations based on a key. For more information, see [Using the I18n module](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffold/blob/master/doc/i18n.md).

## Parameters and Settings
If you need to test your app with a `parameters` section in `dist/manifest.json`, foreman might crash with a message like:

> Would have prompted for a value interactively, but zcli is not listening to keyboard input.

To resolve this problem, set default values for parameters or create a `settings.yml` file in the root directory of your app scaffold-based project, and populate it with your parameter names and test values. For example, using a parameters section like:

```json
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "myParameter"
    }
  ]
}
```

create a `settings.yml` containing:

```yaml
myParameter: 'some value!'
```

## Testing

The App Scaffold is currently setup for testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run specs, run

```
yarn test
```

Specs live under the `spec` directory.

## Deploying

To check that your app will pass the server-side validation check, run

```
zcli apps:validate --path=dist
```

If validation is successful, you can upload the app into your Zendesk account by running

```
zcli apps:create --path=dist
```

To update your app after it has been created in your account, run

```
zcli apps:update --path=dist
```

Or, to create a zip archive for manual upload, run

```
zcli apps:package --path=dist
```

taking note of the created filename.

For more information on the Zendesk Apps Tools please see the [documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/getting_started#zendesk-app-tools).

## External Dependencies
External dependencies are defined in [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffold/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L22). This ensures these dependencies are included in your app's `index.html`.

## Zendesk Garden CSS Components
Included [Zendesk Garden CSS Components](https://garden.zendesk.com/css-components/) are listed in [package.json](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffold/blob/master/package.json#L25) as dev dependencies. Instead of importing them into the app css bundle, we are building a [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) link from the dependencies list and inject the link into `index.html` as another `<style>` tag. Feel free to add/remove the Garden components as needed, webpack will generate and insert the updated link during the build process.
